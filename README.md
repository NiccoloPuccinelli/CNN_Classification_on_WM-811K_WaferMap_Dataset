# Foundations of Deep Learning

This project was carried out together with my colleagues **Marco Scatassi** and **Greta Gravina** and consists of a **classification** task related to the identification of 9 different semiconductor chip anomalies, through the application of **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNN). The language used is **Python**.

You can download the dataset [here](p://mirlab.org/dataSet/public/MIR-WM811K.zip).
