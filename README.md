# Foundations of Deep Learning

This project was carried out together with my colleagues **Marco Scatassi** and **Greta Gravina** and consists of a **classification** task related to the identification of 9 different semiconductor chip anomalies, through the application of **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNN). The language used is **Python**.

Specifically, we applied data augmentation via a **hand-made algorithm** and compared different models on the basis of a customized evaluation metric, achieving a final performance on the test of **97.07% top-1 accuracy**.
